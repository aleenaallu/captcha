Work flow explanation step by step 

 

The user makes a request. 

The request goes through the CaptchaMiddleware middleware. 

If it's a GET request to the /captcha/ URL, the middleware generates a captcha image. 

The generated captcha is stored in the session along with a unique captcha ID. 

The middleware returns the captcha image as a response to the user. 

If it's a POST request to the /captcha/ URL, the middleware validates the captcha entered by the user. 

The entered captcha is compared with the captcha stored in the session to check for validity. 

If the captcha is valid, the user's request is processed further. 

If the captcha is invalid, an appropriate error response is returned. 

If the captcha validation fails multiple times, a retry limit is enforced. 

After processing the user's request, the middleware returns the response. 




functionality of each function: 

  

1. create_random_captcha_text 

This function generates a random CAPTCHA text of the specified captcha_string_size (or the default value if not provided).The CAPTCHA text is created using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.The generated CAPTCHA text is returned as a string. 

  

2. create_image_captcha 

This function creates a CAPTCHA image based on the provided captcha text.The function generates an image with a white background and draws the CAPTCHA text in the center using a random font from a predefined list of fonts.Additionally, it adds random black points and white lines on the image to make the CAPTCHA more complex and difficult for bots to decipher.The function then converts the image to a base64-encoded string and returns it as the CAPTCHA image representation. 

  

3. validate_captcha_text 

This is a static method used to validate the user's input for the CAPTCHA.It takes the request object as input and retrieves the user's input (user_input) and the CAPTCHA text (captcha) and its timestamp (captcha_time) from the session.It compares the user's input with the stored CAPTCHA text and checks if the current time is within the time limit specified for the CAPTCHA (captured in captcha_time).If the user's input matches the CAPTCHA text and the CAPTCHA is still valid (within the time limit), it stores the user's input in the session and returns True.Otherwise, it returns False. 

  

4. validate_captcha_id 

 This is another static method used to validate the CAPTCHA ID.The function takes a captcha_id and the request object as inputs.It first checks if the provided captcha_id is a valid UUID. If it is, the function simply returns the captcha_id.If the captcha_id is not a valid UUID, it indicates that the CAPTCHA was not validated, and the function checks the user's role (user_role) in the request to determine the appropriate redirection URL based on the user's role (customer or superadmin).If the user_role is not specified or not recognized, the function generates a new random UUID as the captcha_id and returns it.
